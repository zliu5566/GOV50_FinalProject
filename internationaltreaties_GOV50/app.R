               legislative branches of government. As per Article II, section 2
               of the U.S. Constitution, the President of the United States 
               'shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the

               treaties, which must then be ratified by a supermajority vote of

               2020. Specifically, it attempts to determine the factors that 
               may impact the number of treaties the U.S. Senate receives from 
               the President in any given year and then tries to use that 
               information to build a model predicting the number of treaties 
               given a set of parameters. I decided to set the timeframe of 
               the treaties included in this project to be from 1949 to 2020
               because I feel that only treaties in this time period are 
               'modern' enough to be useful predictors. 1949 was the year in 
               which the Cold War became 'official,' with the Soviet Union
               developing the atom bomb, China becoming the People's Republic
               of China, and the Western powers signing the North Atlantic
               Treaty (the foundation of NATO). Only then did the world begin 
               to develop our modern understanding of treaties and their 
               importance to global stability. Any treaties signed before 1949 
               were either directly tied to the World Wars (two anomolous events 
               that are unlikely to be good predictors) or be representative of 
               too antiquated a geopolitical outlook (e.g. colonialism). Hence, 
               1949, I believe, is a fine turning point for modern treaties."),

                            for accomplishments and good press, and (2) since

                            unlikely to ratify treaties, the President may be

                            enforce on American soil knowing that the treaty

                            term drops in significance as well, probably 
                            because of the drop in the President Party term. 
                            Even more interesting is that the Senate Party, 
                            although dropping somewhat, is still almost 
                            significant even taking into account Presidential 
                            uniqueness. This strongly suggests that my theory 
                            about Senate/President split is at least somewhat 
                            accurate. Military spending remained the same."),
